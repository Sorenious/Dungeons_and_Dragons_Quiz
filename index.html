<center><h2>What D&amp;D Character Are You?</h2><i>(version 4.10)</i><br><br>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="750"><tbody><tr><td>

So, first off, this is not my work. This is a test I found years and years ago. I loved it so much I saved it to my computer for personal use. Doing so was very fortuitous as the original has long since been lost. If it moved, I was never able to find it. As such, I unfortunately cannot give credit to the original owner.
(Just a heads up, with how old this page is, most, if not all, of the links no longer go where they're intended to go. Seeing as this is not my code, I didn't feel like sifting through pages of text to find and remove said links.)<br><br>
Updates:<br><ul><li>(10/15/2017) I moved the javascript into its own file. If that screwed up the mechanics at all, you can find the page in its original format here: <a href="D&D.htm">Dungeons & Dragons Quiz</a></li>
<li><b>v4.10</b> - (06/01/2002) Another small update.  Settled in for the summer, so I should have time to update
if necessary, although the survey is fast approaching the stage where I'd call it "complete".  I added five more
questions, some lifted from the <a href="http://neppyman.irulethe.net/dndwho/orig.html" target="_blank">
original survey</a>, because that seems to be popular.  A word on that.. I've been told many times that the original
survey produces more accurate results.  The reason for this is that the questions are very blunt and direct, and
if you know what you want to become, it's easy to choose answers to get there.  This version is a bit more cryptic,
so if you want a bit of mystery, stick with this.  <b>PLEASE BE AWARE:</b> As this survey is hosted on my own
webspace on my school's survey, and since I'm planning to graduate at the end of the summer, the survey will be
<b>MOVING</b>.  Where exactly has yet to be determined, but I can only keep a forwarding page up for so long.  Stay
tuned; it will be announced as soon as I have space set up.<br>
</li><li><b>v4.00</b> - (04/30/2002) Yeah, yeah, I know I've been lazy lately, but this one's worth it for everyone
who's been complaining that the test neglected to include Monks, Gnomes, and Half-Orcs.  No longer; they're all
in, complete with some gnomish deities to go with them.  I did <i>not</i> include any orcish deities, primarily
because they're almost completely evil, and a half-orc player character (at least, a good one) would be more likely
to lean towards the human side of their nature.  If you want orcish deities to add to your ravenously evil 
character, look them up yourself.  In the meantime, enjoy the updated survey.  Also, in order to help differentiate
the additions, a couple of new answers to questions have been added.<br>
</li><li><b>v3.01</b> - (03/14/2002) Made a few minor cosmetic tweaks to the page over the last week or so - thanks to
everyone who sent in bug reports and such.  Also, I was informed by a Forgetten Realms-inclined friend of mine that
the stereotypical Lawful Good dwarven deity would be Moradin, so the survey has been changed updated accordingly.
Thanks for Arn!e for helping me out with that.  Also, for those who are interested in Legend of the Five Rings (L5R),
my friend Johnny put up <a href="http://members.aol.com/gaijintrader/faction.html" target="_mt">his own survey</a>,
based on my code (I helped him a bit, but he's pretty talented to begin with... *grins*).  If you're interested in
L5R, <a href="http://members.aol.com/gaijintrader/faction.html" target="_mt">head on over</a> and take his survey.<br>
</li><li><b>v3.00</b> - (03/03/2002) Added Forgotten Realms deities to the list of results.  Lots of them - 32, to be
specific, and the survey will match your character up with one based on alignment (primarily), and then race and
class.  The descriptions are still being finalized (expect a revision later this week), and anyone who wants to
offer some assistance should <a href="mailto:neppyman@yahoo.com">drop me a line</a>.  Also, anyone with artistic
talent who would be willing to help me out by drawing symbol pictures for all the deities (40x40 pixels would
be quite sufficient) should <a href="mailto:neppyman@yahoo.com">let me know</a>.  To take a look at the list of
deities that I'm using, click <a href="http://neppyman.irulethe.net/dndwho/char-possible.html" target="_mt">here</a>.<br>
</li><li><b>v2.22</b> - (02/26/2002) Added one question and more answers to a few questions.  Also, redid the browser
recommendations into a neat table.  Added a link showing all possible results.  I recommend <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_mt">Mozilla</a> as the browser of choice to use for this survey; of
all the browsers I've tested, on all the platforms, it yields the best results.<br>
</li><li><b>v2.21</b> - (02/21/2002) Full HTML 4.01 Transitional compliance achieved!  If that doesn't fix problems
with pesky browsers, nothing will.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.figment.org/" target="_mt">Figment</a> for the suggestions that let me pull this off.<br>
</li><li><b>v2.20</b> - (02/21/2002) As suggested, I took the rather naive tie-breaking 
algorithm for breaking ties with alignment, and made it much more robust.  The survey is configured to 
generate specific (e.g. Lawful Neutral) alignments associated with each question.  If that produces a single 
highest alignment, that's what you get.  If not, it sums up law vs. chaos and good vs. evil, and resolves 
ties in favor of neutrality.  From my own test runs, this produces pretty good (and accurate) results, but 
if you feel otherwise, feel free to <a href="mailto:neppyman@yahoo.com">tell me what you think</a>.<br>
</li><li><b>v2.10</b> - (02/19/2002) Fixed minor code bug that was improperly handling ties in primary classes.
Thanks to <a href="mailto:michael@whiterose.org">Michael Croft</a> for helping me with this!<br>
</li><li><b>v2.01</b> - (02/19/2002) Fixed JavaScript bug that was preventing MacOS users (and others) from viewing 
the page or taking the test.<br>
</li></ul><br>

This survey will attempt to, in a few short questions, determine your race, alignment, and primary/secondary
class, as a D&amp;D character.  We make no guarantees for accuracy, and this is simply for fun, so don't complain if
you feel insulted or upset by some of the things you see.  With that in mind, please take the time to read
the questions completely, as some of the answers are surprising.  Also, don't try to guess the system used
in determining these things (although you can read the source if you'd like, once you're done), because
that would really defeat the purpose.  And yes, there's some inside jokes here.<br><br>

<b>By Request:</b> If you would like to see a list of all possible results, click <a href="http://neppyman.irulethe.net/dndwho/char-possible.html" target="_mt">here</a> to get that.<br><br>

<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> This test requires support for both JavaScript and pop-up windows.  If your browser 
doesn't support both of them, you're out of luck.  Unfortunately, there's no other way to do the 
survey - there's over 2000 possible results, and I have to generate them on the fly.  And since U of I 
doesn't let us run CGI scripts on their server, I'm stuck with JavaScript to do the generation.<br><br>

<a class="question">29. A group of adventurers heads off into the
world, intent on making a name for themselves. As a member of this
group, what is your role in the party?</a>
<br><br>
<input name="q29" value="1" type="radio"> The Leader.  I tell everybody what to do and when to do it.<br>
<input name="q29" value="2" type="radio"> Second in Command. I have
leadership skills, but I hate making the big decisions. I'll handle
arranging what must be done, if somebody else tells me what that is.<br>
<input name="q29" value="3" type="radio"> The Brains of the Outfit. I'm
not a leader, but I'm great at ideas. I'll toss them out, and let the
rest of the party figure out how to actually implement them.<br>
<input name="q29" value="4" type="radio"> The Follower (aka The Grunt).
I'm not a leader, and I'm not an idea person. Point me in the right
direction and tell me what to do, thank you.<br>
<input name="q29" value="5" type="radio"> Moral Compass. I may not be
the leader, but I will definately speak up as to what the party should
or shouldn't be doing, based on my own moral code. This may or may not
be annoying.. but probably is.<br>
<input name="q29" value="6" type="radio"> The Lone Wolf.  While I may be a member of the party, I will always stick to myself and be distant from the other members.<br>
<input name="q29" value="7" type="radio"> The Opportunist (aka The
Backstabber). I'll play along up until the point where it's time to
divide the loot. That's when the Knives of Betrayal come into play..<br>

<a class="question">30. The group of adventurers you're with breaks open a cave filled with treasure.  What catches your eye first?</a>
<br><br>
<input name="q30" value="1" type="radio"> The stacks and piles of gold and jewels.<br>
<input name="q30" value="2" type="radio"> The strangely glowing sword mounted on the wall.<br>
<input name="q30" value="3" type="radio"> The many-faceted jewel that feels somewhat cold to the touch.<br>
<input name="q30" value="4" type="radio"> The ancient shrine to some long-forgotten deity, recessed into the wall.<br>
<input name="q30" value="5" type="radio"> The jewel-encrusted harp leaning against the wall.<br>
<input name="q30" value="6" type="radio"> The hand-carved wooden statue in the corner.<br>
<input name="q30" value="7" type="radio"> The dusty tome on a pedestal, with an odd-looking cover.<br>

</p><p></p><hr><p>

<a class="question">31. Now it's time to divide up the loot.  What do you do?</a>
<br><br>
<input name="q31" value="1" type="radio"> Stick knives in the rest of the party and take it all.<br>
<input name="q31" value="2" type="radio"> Everyone shares equally, no more and no less than anyone else.<br>
<input name="q31" value="3" type="radio"> Most of the profits go to the
family of the poor henchman who disarmed the traps at the cost of his
life. Or, at least, to buy another roll of duct tape.<br>
<input name="q31" value="4" type="radio"> Whatever is decided on, I'm tithing most of my share.<br>
<input name="q31" value="5" type="radio"> I'll just take this one
little piece and leave the rest for the party. I won't mention that it
happens to be the most valuable item.<br>
<input name="q31" value="6" type="radio"> Who cares?  I'm spending my reward on ale and whores, so I'll take enough to keep me busy until the next adventure.<br>

</p><p></p><hr><p>

<a class="question">32. Oops.  Seems there was a Great Red Wyrm waiting for you when you left the cave.  Think fast!</a>
<br><br>
<input name="q32" value="1" type="radio"> Run.  Really fast.  Thinking can wait.<br>
<input name="q32" value="2" type="radio"> I only have to run faster than the slowest party member..<br>
<input name="q32" value="3" type="radio"> Draw sword.  Roll initiative.<br>
<input name="q32" value="4" type="radio"> Fear my Magic Missile!<br>
<input name="q32" value="5" type="radio"> Pray.  Very hard.  And pray that it works.<br>
<input name="q32" value="6" type="radio"> I know I have a scroll of Slay Dragon somewhere in my backpack..<br>

<a class="question">33. Seems you're a bit short on ready gold, and you need some food.  What do you do?</a>
<br><br>
<input name="q33" value="1" type="radio"> Sing for my supper at the nearest tavern or noble's house.<br>
<input name="q33" value="2" type="radio"> Slit the purse (or throat) of some wealthy-looking individual.<br>
<input name="q33" value="3" type="radio"> Go to the nearest temple and ask for charity.<br>
<input name="q33" value="4" type="radio"> Put on a charlatan's show and do some simple stage magic.<br>
<input name="q33" value="5" type="radio"> Sell that magic item you've been holding on to "for a rainy day".<br>
<input name="q33" value="6" type="radio"> Hire yourself out as a bodyguard.<br>
<input name="q33" value="7" type="radio"> Ask the local constable if there's any wrongs that need righting.<br>
